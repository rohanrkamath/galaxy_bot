## FAQs

**1. Who is the developer of this bot? And what are the contact details?**

I am solely the creator and developer of this bot. You can contact me on Discord (_Amishhh#1337) or twitter (rohan__kamath).

**2. Was the bot verified by Discord?**

Yes! I am a Verified Discord bot developer and the bot has been verified by Discord. 

**3. Why is the bot not online anymore?**

As much I as would love to keep it online and maintain it, AWS costs started sky-rocketing, and I clearly couldn't afford it, and I am not the greatest fan of free half ass hosting services like Heroku. This is why I decided to make the code public, so as to help other aspiring bot dev to have a starting ground.
